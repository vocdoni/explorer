# explorer

This repository contains the **new** frontend web application that acts as an 'explorer' for the Vocdoni voting blockchain. This explorer allows you to see elections, organizations, and individual votes, as well as raw blocks on the blockchain.
It is a react application available to the public at https://explorer.vote/.

## Getting Started

### Environment variables

You can create a `.env.local` file to set your custom environment variables
there, here's a list of variables you can use:

- `VOCDONI_ENVIRONMENT`: the vocdoni environment to be used, either
  `dev`, `stg` or `prod` (defaults to `stg`).
- `BASE_URL` is used to specify the public base page during build.
- `BUILD_PATH` Specifies the destination of built files.

You can also start the app by prefixing these vars instead of defining your
custom `.env` file:

```bash
VOCDONI_ENVIRONMENT=dev yarn start
# or an example using many of them...
BUILD_PATH=build/dev BASE_URL=/ui-scaffold/dev VOCDONI_ENVIRONMENT=dev yarn build
```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open
[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser (note
the port may change if already used).

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br /> It correctly bundles
React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### `yarn translations`

Extracts all i18n strings from the code and puts them in the `i18n/locales` json
files. The best way to work with translations is:

### Branching and deploys
